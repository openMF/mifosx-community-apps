Limits
======

1. Default entries to fields in loan and savings import worksheets are set for the first 1000 rows. After that data validation rules still apply, but default filling of fields on selecting the product does not work.

2. The group import sheet format right now has a maximum upper limit of 100 clients per group.

3. Special characters in names (such as office name, client name, staff name, loan product name) will break the naming conventions used in Excel and no data can be entered which refers to these names.

4. In some cases, where the name itself starts with a number or special character, the template cannot be generated and results in a download error.
